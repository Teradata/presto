`Airpal`_ is preinstalled on both Presto Sandbox VMs. Airpal is a web-base query execution tool built on top of Presto. Once you have started the Presto Sandbox VM, simply point the browser of your host machine to `<http://[guest-ip-address]:8181/>`_ and the Airpal web application will load. From here you can issue queries to Presto via Airpal.
